  The topic that has the potential to set off a chain of events that go well

  of us choose to deny that even the topic of The Existence of God even exists!
  Lose yourself for a minute to find yourself. This pink elephant isn't going
  away. This moment right now could be the answer you've been looking for and
  waiting for. This could be the most pivotal moment in your very existence.
  When I said lose yourself, I meant imagine stripping yourself of your career,
  money, things, status, etc; anything that competes for supremacy in your life.
  All the big pleasures and small ones. The smoke and mirrors we've been
  accustomed to living life through. Now imagine living day to day and not
  knowing if tonight has a bright day that follows. Because it might be a
  nightmare or it just might be bright. So now you find yourself questioning the
  very fiber of your existence. Come on, everybody does. Maybe not always. But
  it's inevitable. It's inescapable. You have this need, this desire for
  significance, and a hunger for purpose. You have this void or hole inside you
  that still isn't satisfied. You've read every self-help book on the bestseller
  list but the euphoria only lasts a few days, and maybe a few months if you're
  fortunate enough. Sure, you take away some good principles but that doesn't
  seem to extinguish that whisper in your soul that says, "Is there something
  more? What if there is?" But as quickly as it comes, it goes because the cares
  of this world and your current reality(or is it) drown it out again. If you
  don't believe in a soul just think of it as your deepest thoughts and
  inclinations, the part of you that you don't allow time to evaluate.

## **The Existence of God**

The topic that has the potential to set off a chain of events that go well into an eternity you may not believe in. This issue is so important that some of us choose to deny that even the topic of The Existence of God even exists! Lose yourself for a minute to find yourself. This pink elephant isn't going away. This moment right now could be the answer you've been looking for and waiting for. This could be the most pivotal moment in your very existence. When I said lose yourself, I meant imagine stripping yourself of your career, money, things, status, etc; anything that competes for supremacy in your life. All the big pleasures and small ones. The smoke and mirrors we've been accustomed to living life through. Now imagine living day to day and not knowing if tonight has a bright day that follows. Because it might be a nightmare or it just might be bright. So now you find yourself questioning the very fiber of your existence. Come on, everybody does. Maybe not always. But it's inevitable. It's inescapable. You have this need, this desire for significance, and a hunger for purpose. You have this void or hole inside you that still isn't satisfied. You've read every self-help book on the bestseller list but the euphoria only lasts a few days, and maybe a few months if you're fortunate enough. Sure, you take away some good principles but that doesn't seem to extinguish that whisper in your soul that says, "Is there something more? What if there is?" But as quickly as it comes, it goes because the cares of this world and your current reality(or is it) drown it out again. If you don't believe in a soul just think of it as your deepest thoughts and inclinations, the part of you that you don't allow time to evaluate.

I wrestled with doubts most of my life. In fact, I still do from time to time when it comes to God's existence. But I think that what I have to say is legitimate. I have excellent reason to believe that God exists and that we can actually know him, and spend the rest of eternity outside of space and time getting to know him! This fix isn't temporary and finite but it is infinite and eternal! You ready...?

In the beginning was the Big Bang. Right? Ok, so we can agree on that. Stay with me it gets better, I promise. Since the Universe is losing energy or winding down it's safe to say it is limited and finite. We see this all around us. Bodies get old and frail, cars breakdown, and things fall apart. Which brings me to the Law of Causality, which states that every limited thing or effect has a cause other than itself.Just like this blog. The very fact that you're reading this shows that it is the effect of a mind that created it. So through the scientific method that's based on empirical evidence or things we can measure, repeat, and observe we know that everything that has a beginning must have been caused by something else! This is incredible! The Universe had a beginning therefore, we can conclude that it was caused by something else and this cause was God!

You might say, well what caused God, right? That's a good question! If this was the case then there would be an infinite regress of these causes into the eternal past. If you keep saying that one finite thing caused another finite thing then that doesn't solve the problem. Therefore, there must be a first uncaused cause of all finite things that change!

In summary:

1.   1. Therefore, the Universe was caused by something else, and this cause was God.
